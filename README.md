This is the disassembly of my own hack of Pokémon Crystal called PokeCrystal2.

To build the game, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

List of major changes
* **Pokemon that evolve by trading now can be evolved using a Link Cable.**
* **Pokemon that evolve by trading while holding a specific item now can evolve using that item.**
* **All Pokemon will now be able to be obtained without trading.** Legendary Pokemon listed below can only be found after beating Red for the first time. Bolded items are completed
  * **All Pokemon normally unavailable in Crystal are found at routes that they are found on in other Gen 2 games.**
  * **All starter Pokemon are found at the Safari Zone.**
  * **Articuno is found at the Seafoam Islands. Requires Surf.**
  * **Zapdos is found outside of the Kanto Power Plant.**
  * **Moltres is found in a new section of Mt. Silver Cave. Requires Surf and Waterfall.**
  * **Mewtwo is found in Cerulean Cave.**
  * **Mew is found at Faraway Island. You will need to get the Faraway Map before you are able to go there.**
  * **Celebi will be found through the event that was only released in Japan.** Able to start after beating Red.
* **The Odd Egg Pokemon list has been reworked.** All Pokemon have an equal chance of being shiny and a roughly equal chance at hatching. The DVs for each non-shiny Pokemon are maxed out, while the shiny versions are the max available, not including Tyrogue which has the same Attack and Defense DVs.
* **Your Mom will get many more different items when she goes shopping.** You will be able to get all of the decorations including the trophies. Something special is available to those who are super savers.
* **Unown now has a new way of getting it's letter.** Now every Unown can be shiny. - PokeSeer cannot read caught data for Unown due to this.
* **6 new Unowns.** 2 of them are the exclamation point and the question mark. The other 4 are period, comma, hyphen, and interrobang (!?). - Current unavailable due to a bug.
* **There is now a dark type boost after beating Karen for the first time.** This means you can lose after Karen and still receive the bonus, you just have to beat her once. - This has not been extensively tested yet.
* **Add rematches for all Pokemon Gym Leaders.** Johto leaders are located at the Olivine Cafe. Kanto leaders are located at the Celadon Cafe. - This has not been extensively tested yet.
* Add a Move Relearner. - This has not been extensively tested yet.
* 2 new pokemon. Gidgeon - a fakemon baby Delibird. ??? - ???
* New item pocket that holds all the Type Boost Items.
* Pokemon now have evolution moves.
